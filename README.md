# CS-255

The DriverPass project has us performing the design stage of the SDLC. We went into detail developing the necessary charts and diagrams in order to properly speculate on the best way to complete the project and deliver a valid product to the client (the CEO of DriverPass).

The system they wanted us to design was a website in order to help people trying to get there drivers license through the DMV. This is accomplished by allowing the users to create an account and either schedule an appointment with a certified DriverPass driving instructor or partake in classes/tests through the website that follow DMV guidelines.

My use case diagrams accurately depict the use cases I depicted, whereas if I could I would choose to reconstruct the class diagram. I would take more time to detail the classes included in the systems and the relations between them.

I made sure in the software design I included the ability for the site administrators to update the site as necessary if any changes are made in regards to DMV policies. I also included the ability for accounts to be created and that each account has a certain level of security attached to it so that the customers do not have the same site access as the IT specialists.

For future projects I would like to approach the design of the system in the same manner as this project. Where each detail is covered and depicted some way in a chart or diagram and a timeline is set up to give the team a visual as to how long the project should take and when certain assignments should be completed.
